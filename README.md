# RESTAPI

#Introduction.


Hello and welcome Read me file for Data Processing of the student Jose Loperena
Monzón (Pepe). In the document, I will explain step by step how to run the API
application if needed. 

The documents to do this will be in the GitHub Repository.

Step by step how to make the visualization work.
1. Run the “movies” folder on a local server (Preferably XAAMP).
2. Start the API after starting the local server.
3. Use the application.
4. If all was done correctly, Please check Localhost:8080/movies/index.html. If something shows, then it has worked.
